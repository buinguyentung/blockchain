Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records.
The term “blockchain” is usually strongly tied to concepts like transactions, smart contracts or cryptocurrencies.

I will learn how to code the basic concepts that are needed for a working cryptocurrency. The programming language is Python.\

The most necessary:
-	Index: the height of the block in the blockchain
-	Data: any data is included in the block
-	Timestamp: creation time of the block
-	previousHash: a reference to the hash of the previous block
-	Hash: a sha256 generated from all above contents of the block
